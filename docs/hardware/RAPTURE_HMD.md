# RAPTURE HMD

The RAPTURE HMD is the connected VR headset intended to run in-tandem with the [RAPTURE Backtop](../hardware/RAPTURE_Backtop.md). 

!!! info "Disclaimer"  
    Three versions of the RAPTURE HMD exist. This page will only cover the "RAPTURE HMD", which is the version used in all VECs after early 2017 containing a modified Oculus Rift CV1. Eventually, there will be documentation covering the DK2 RAPTURE HMD and RAPTURE 2K (curved OLED).
