# XVoid

So far, XVoid appears only once, within the Wreck-It Ralph game, alongside Void.

The reason for the name "XVoid" is unclear, but there are two prevailing theories:

1. XVoid represents their newer system, with the "X" standing for "Extended." This API was likely created for use in future games, as some functions in older games seem to have been put into the XVoid plugin.

2. Alternatively, it could have been an old plugin that is now deprecated, as it no longer appears in newer games like Jumanji, with most of its functions missing.

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    As some functions are labeled without XVoid in games older than Wreck-It Ralph, we won't create separate documentation for XVoid functions (unless they are only seen in XVoid API), but we will indicate if a function appears in XVoid.
