# VOID API

Documentation for the VOID API and the tooling used by the games.

The information here reflects what we have discovered and verified (mostly through decompilation). This is not a complete reference! We document the functions and features that we use.

The VOID APIs evolves the newer the game. APIs and internal behavior may differ between games; some functions may be unavailable or behave differently in other games.

We have SDKs for the following games:

+ "NICO" (Nicodemus: Demon of Evanishment)
+ "WIR2" (Ralph Breaks VR)
+ "LookingGlass" (Jumanji: Reverse the Curse)
