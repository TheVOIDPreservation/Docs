# VOID API

Documentation for the VOID API and the tooling used by the games.

The information here reflects what we have discovered and verified (mostly through decompilation), including examples and common use cases. This is not a complete reference! We document the functions and features that we use.

The VOID APIs evolves over time. APIs and behavior may differ between games; some functions may be unavailable or behave differently in other games.

You can view all of our game APIs on our GitHub, where comprehensive Unreal Header Tool (UHT) headers are provided by us.
