# Void Blueprint Utilities

Blueprint utilities are used throughout the games.

In more recent games, these utilities are typically part of the Void plugin API. However, in older games like Nicodemus, they are included in the main game modules.

All blueprint utilities will be documented here, as they often perform the same functions but may belong to different APIs. We will also specify the games in which they are found or not found.
